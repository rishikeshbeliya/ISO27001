# ISO 27001:2022 Risk & Gap Assessment, Treatment & Compliance Implementation Project

This project involved performing a comprehensive **Information Security Risk Assessment and Compliance Implementation** based on the **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** standard.  
The objective was to strengthen the organization’s security posture by identifying information security risks, evaluating existing controls, and developing a structured **Risk Treatment Plan** and **Statement of Applicability (SoA)** aligned with ISO 27001 Annex A controls.

## 🧩 Project Overview
- Conducted a detailed **asset-based risk assessment** covering information systems, network components, applications, and human assets.  
- Identified and categorized **threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts** across **14 control domains** of ISO 27001.  
- Designed a **Risk Register** documenting likelihood, impact, and risk ratings for **100+ identified assets**.  
- Developed a comprehensive **Risk Treatment Plan** prioritizing high and medium risks, assigning control owners, and defining mitigation timelines.  
- Created and maintained a **Statement of Applicability (SoA)** by mapping all **93 Annex A controls** to organizational risk scenarios, providing justification for control inclusion or exclusion.  
- Recommended actionable improvements for **policy alignment, incident management, and access control**, leading to measurable enhancement of compliance readiness.
